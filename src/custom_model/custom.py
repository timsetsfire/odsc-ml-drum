    Intended to apply transformations to the prediction data before making predictions. This is
    most useful if **drum** supports the model's library, but your model requires additional data
    processing before it can make predictions

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : is the dataframe given to **drum** to make predictions on
    model : is the deserialized model loaded by **drum** or by `load_model`, if supplied

    Returns

#     This hook is only needed if you would like to use **drum** with a framework not natively
#     supported by the tool.

#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     data : is the dataframe to make predictions against. If `transform` is supplied,
#     `data` will be the transformed data.
#     model : is the deserialized model loaded by **drum** or by `load_model`, if supplied

#     - `positive_class_label` is the positive class label for a binary classification model
#     - `negative_class_label` is the negative class label for a binary classification model

#     Returns
#     -------
#     This method should return predictions as a dataframe with the following format:
#       Binary Classification: must have columns for each class label with floating- point class
#         probabilities as values. Each row should sum to 1.0
#       Regression: must have a single column called `Predictions` with numerical values
